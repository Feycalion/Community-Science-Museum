## Description

For this assignment I had a month to design and build a website for a fictional Community Science Museum, using everything I had learned during the semester.

## Assignment Brief

An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. 

Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. 

The museum wants an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents. 

The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent. 

The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. 

The website should be responsive and easy to use on various devices.
